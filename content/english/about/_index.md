I moved down to Christchurch two years ago from the north island and love to be in the great outdoors. On my days off you'll find me tramping, rock climbing, or hanging out with my rabbit, Milo.

I have a wealth of experience both as a mental health support worker and as a rock climbing instructor. So I am very used to helping anxious people feel comfortable! I will ensure your wedding ceremony is run with confidence, ease, and humour to keep you relaxed and enjoying your big day.
